# CIR-License
Your Computer, Your Input, Your Responsibility License

## About
Well, I needed a license, universal and transparent.
So here it is.

## TL;DR about the license
You may distribute, modify, etc. (just whatever you want) the content licensed under this license.
Under the following terms:
- Distribute non-commercial (can't sell it / make money off of it)
- Share alike (just include the same license and make it open-source too)
- You do not come whining to the creator if something doesn't work how you want it to.
