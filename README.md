# CIR-License
Your Computer, Your Input, Your Responsibility License

## About
Well, I needed a license, universal and transparent.
So here it is.

## TL;DR about the license
You may distribute, modify, etc. (just whatever you want) the content licensed under this license.
Under the following terms:
- Distribute non-commercial (can't sell it / make money off of it)
- Share alike (just include the same license and make it open-source too)
- You do not come whining to the creator if something doesn't work how you want it to.

## How do I use it?
Well, it is simple. Just include one of the text files (license.md or license.txt) with your work.
and maybe put a little ``This work is licensed under the CIR-License, found at https://github.com/Yuri010/CIR-License``
in some files
